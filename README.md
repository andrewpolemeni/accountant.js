# accountant.js
Accountant.js is a vanilla javascript open source project.
It contains simple functions to calculate functions related to finance. 
Currently a small library but would love to grow it in size.

# Current Methods
let a = accountant.calculateCompoundInterestTotalAmount(10, 5, 20, 1); <br />
let b = accountant.calculateCompoundInterest(10, 5, 20, 1); <br />
let c = accountant.getPresentValue(10000, 5, 20);<br />
let d = accountant.getFutureValue(10000, 5, 20);<br />
console.log(a, b, c, d); // output result of method to console.<br />
